# Time-series-prediction

Prediction of time series over n steps using scipy and sklearn.
The series is decomposed into trend, seasonnal and noise, with randomForest. Best decomposition periods can be automatically determined. 
Seasonnalities and trend are then predicted n steps forward.

Here are some examples of predictions generated by the program :
