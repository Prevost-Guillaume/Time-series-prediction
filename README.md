# Time-series-prediction

Prediction of time series over n steps using scipy and sklearn.
The series is decomposed into trend, seasonnal and noise, with randomForest. Best decomposition periods can be automatically determined. 
Seasonnalities and trend are then predicted n steps forward.
The solution won the Analytica Vidhya challenge "Time series forecasting"

Here are some examples of predictions generated by the program :

This last example is actually the winning solution of the challenge.


## How does it works ?
